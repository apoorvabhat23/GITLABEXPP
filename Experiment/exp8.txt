Experiment 8:   
Write the command to display the last five commits in the repository's history. 
To display the last five commits in the repository's history, use: 
git log --oneline -n 5 
Explanation: 
 git log → Displays commit history 
 --oneline → Shows each commit in a single line (shorter output) 
 -n 5 → Limits output to the last 5 commits 
More detailed view, including commit messages and authors: 
To display the last five commits with detailed information (including commit messages, 
authors, and timestamps), use: 
git log -n 5 --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s" 
Explanation: 
 git log -n 5 → Shows the last 5 commits 
 --pretty=format:"..." → Customizes the log output: 
o %h → Short commit hash 
o %an → Author name 
o %ar → Relative commit time (e.g., 2 days ago) 
o %s → Commit message
