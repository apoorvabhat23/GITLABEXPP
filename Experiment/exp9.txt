Experiment 9: 
Write the command to cherry-pick a range of commits from &quot;source- branch&quot; to the 
current branch. 
To cherry-pick a range of commits from "source-branch" to the current branch, use: 
git cherry-pick <start-commit-hash>^..<end-commit-hash> 
Steps: 
1. Switch to the branch where you want to apply the commits: 
2. git checkout target-branch 
3. Identify the commit hashes using: 
4. git log --oneline source-branch 
5. Cherry-pick the range of commits: 
6. git cherry-pick <start-commit-hash>^..<end-commit-hash> 
Example: 
If you want to cherry-pick commits from e4f5g6h to i7j8k9l: 
git cherry-pick e4f5g6h^..i7j8k9l 
Note: The ^ before the first commit ensures that it includes e4f5g6h in the range. 
Cherry-Pick Multiple Non-Consecutive Commits 
If you need to cherry-pick specific commits (not a range), list them individually: 
git cherry-pick e4f5g6h i7j8k9l m0n1o2p
