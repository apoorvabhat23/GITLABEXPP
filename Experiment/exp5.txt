Merging allows you to combine changes from one branch into another. However, sometimes 
conflicts arise if the same part of a file is modified in multiple branches. Hereâ€™s how to merge 
branches and resolve conflicts in Git. 

Commands:
git checkout main 
git merge <branch-name> 
git status 
git add <filename> 
Description

git merge --abort 
git push origin main 
Cancel the merge 
Push merged changes to the remote repository
