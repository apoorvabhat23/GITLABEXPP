3.  Pulling updates from a remote repository 
 Exploring git fetch and git merge 
Pulling updates from a remote repository allows you to fetch and merge changes that others have 
made (or that you've made on another machine) into your local repository. Here's how to do it: 

Commands
1. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository: 
2. git pull origin <branch_name> 
Example: 
git pull origin main 
3. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them manually, add the changes, and commit: 
4. git add <file_name> 
5. git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict" 
6. Check the status of your repository: 
7. git status 
8. View commit history to verify changes: 
9. git log --oneline</p>
